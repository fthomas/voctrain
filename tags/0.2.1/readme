   Installation:
   -------------
   
   Just unpack the tarball somewhere on your harddrive und start
   the php_voctrain program with:
   
      ~$ ./vt-0.2.1
   
   The Gtk extension for Python (pygtk) is needed to run version 0.2.1
   of php_voctrain. Also the xml, glade and python-gnome package. 
   
 
   About php_voctrain:
   -------------------
   
   php_voctrain is a very simple vocabulary trainer using xml files as
   vocabulary database, so that users can easily write their own files.
   The programm is able to load diefferent xml files than the
   "latin.pvtml" as long as it uses the same DTD. It also can handle
   kvtml documents used by kvoctrain. You only have to add the language
   tag to the native kvoctrain files. For more information see
   voctrain.dtd.
   
   I would be very pleased if you send me your self-written xml files, so
   that I can distribute it in the original archive.

   Have fun!
