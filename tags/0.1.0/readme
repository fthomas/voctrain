   The PHP Gtk extension is needed to run php_voctrain. Information
   and source code of this extension can be obtained from 
   http://gtk.php.net (thanks to Andrei and all others for their great
   work!)
   You also need to configure your PHP using '--with-xml'

   
   About php_voctrain:
   -------------------
   
   php_voctrain is a very simple vocabulary trainer using xml files as
   vocabulary database, so that users can easily write their own files.
   The programm is able to load diefferent xml files than the
   "pvt_latein.xml" as long as it uses the same DTD. I would be very
   pleased if you send me your self-written xml files, so that I can
   distribute it in the original archive.

   Have fun!
